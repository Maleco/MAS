\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch Let us first look at the simplest version of the game. In this version, there are two Spies and three Good players, who will go on five missions. Good Players will always succeed a mission, and Spies always have to fail if they\uc1\u8217\'92re on a mission. Although this might not be the most interesting way to play the game, it is a little bit easier to analyze. We could use this analysis as a basis for more elaborate versions of the game.\line Initially, the Kripke model will look like this:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch No player can distinguish between the worlds where they are not Spies themselves. From a world where a player is a Spy, that world is also the only reachable world, since the player then knows the actual alignment of all the players.\line The names of the worlds in this model correspond to the players that are Spies. For instance, in world (1, 2), player 1 and player 2 are Spies. Now let\uc1\u8217\'92s assume that propositional atom a stands for \uc1\u8220\'93player 1 is a Spy\uc1\u8221\'94, b stands for \uc1\u8220\'93player 2 is a Spy\uc1\u8221\'94, etcetera. Then we can also say that in world (1, 2), a and b are both true, and therefore (a^b) holds. We also assume that the worlds are always reflexive, so every world is reachable from itself for all agents.\line In this version of the game, there are three distinct possibilities for the first mission: a mission with one Spy, a mission with two Spies and a mission without any spies. Let\uc1\u8217\'92s look at all of these different possibilities. \line If two Spies go on the first mission, they will both fail the mission. In this case, everybody knows that the two Spies were on this mission. Let\uc1\u8217\'92s assume that those Spies were player 1 and 2. The Kripke model will look like this afterwards:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch As you can see, only one possible world is left. This world is also the real world, where 1 and 2 are Spies. Since it is the only possible reachable world for all players, it is also common knowledge that 1 and 2 are Spies. In this case, the Good players have already won. They can just reject every mission with one of the Spies on it.\line Let us now look at one of the other cases, which is a little bit more interesting. If there are two Good players on the first mission, the mission succeeds. Let\uc1\u8217\'92s say that player 3 and 4 went on this mission. Since there are no fails, every player now knows that players 3 and 4 are not Spies and that they are, in fact, Good. Therefore, the worlds where one of them is a Spy aren\uc1\u8217\'92t possible for any of the players anymore. The Kripke model now looks like this:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch In this case, every player knows that between players 1, 2 and 5 there are two Spies. Player 5 now knows the true world. Since he knows he isn\uc1\u8217\'92t a Spy himself, and he knows that 3 and 4 are not Spies, he can now deduce that player 1 and 2 are Spies. You can also see this in the Kripke model. World (1,2) is the only r}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}eachable world for player 5. Therefore, M}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}1,2}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is true that}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}5}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b). If K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}5}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} is not a Spy, e is not true. This is only the case in world (1, 2). In this world, (a^b) also holds. Thus, M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\'ace \uc0\u8594  (a^b). It is even the case that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\'ace \uc0\u8594  K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}5}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b). Intuitively, this also seems logical. Players now know that if player 5 is a Good guy, 1 and 2 are Spies, and 5 also knows this. The same can be said about 1 and 2.\line With two good players on the first mission, the Good Players can also always win. They can just put one of the three players that weren\uc1\u8217\'92t on the first mission on the next missions to discern who the Spies are in at most two missions (which would result in at most two fails). If one of those missions fails, the players know that the player that wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t player 3 or 4 is a Spy. If it doesn\uc1\u8217\'92t, he must be Good. Let us look what happens with the knowledge when 3, 4 and 2 go on the second mission. Since 2 is a Spy, this mission will fail. Every world where one of the Spies isn\uc1\u8217\'92t player 3, 4 and 2 is not reachable for any of the players after this mission. Since the worlds where player 3 or 4 were Spies are already gone, only worlds where player 2 is a Spy will remain. This results in the following Kripke model:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch In all of the remaining worlds, b is true. Therefore, it is common knowledge that 2 is a Spy.\line On the next mission, the same tactic can be used to see what the alignment of player 1 or 5 is. This automatically reveals the alignment of the last unknown player. Everybody now knows who the Spies are and only one world will be left. The Good players can now leave the Spies out of the last mission, which will result in a victory for the Good team.\line There is one option left for the first mission, which is probably the most interesting one. If there is one Spy on the mission, the mission will fail, but players that were not on that mission will not know }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}which of the two players was a Spy. Let us look at the case where 1 and 3 go on the first mission. After this mission, every world where 1 and 3 both aren\uc1\u8217\'92t Spies and the world where they are both Spies won\uc1\u8217\'92t be reachable anymore, and the Kripke model will look like this:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch As you can see, in all worlds that are reachable for player 3 where 3 is not a Spy himself, 1 is a Spy. We can therefore conclude that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\'acc \uc0\u8594  K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}3}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}a. The same can be said about 1. So, if player 1 was a Good player, he would now know 3 is a Spy.\line Since every player knows that 1 and 3 can\uc1\u8217\'92t both be Spies, they know there must be at least one Spy amongst the remaining players. You can also see this in the Kripke model: in every world that is reachable for at least one agent, b, d or e is true. Therefore, we can say that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(bvdve). We assume that every player proposes and votes on missions as if they were a Good player, so it wouldn\uc1\u8217\'92t make sense for any of the players to propose players 2, 4 and 5 together for the next mission. They already know there is one Spy amongst those players, so it will never gain them new information. Putting both 1 and 3 on the second mission doesn\uc1\u8217\'92t make much sense either. It is already known that one of them is a Spy, so the mission will definitely fail. This will result in the second point for the Spies, but it still won\uc1\u8217\'92t be possible to know if 1 or 3 is a Spy. Therefore, the Good players have a very small chance of winning if they do this. If we rule out the previous two teams out for mission two, three possibilities remain. If 3, 4 and 5 go on the second mission, the mission will succeed. This will mean that every world where 3, 4 or 5 was a Spy will not be possible for the players anymore. The only remaining world, then, is the one where 1 and 2 are Spies, so it becomes common knowledge that they are. The Good players have now won.\line The second possibility is that the second mission contains both of the Spies. If, for example, 1, 2 and 4 are put on a mission, the mission will show two fails. This will reveal that every player that wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t on that mission can never be a Spy, so every world where they are will not be possible anymore. Since 3 wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t on that mission and every world contained either 1 or 3 after the first mission, everybody can now conclude that player 3 is a Spy. This is also visible in the resulting Kripke model:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch In all of the remaining worlds, a is true. Thus, M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}a. This has now become common knowledge. Furthermore, from the model it follows that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\'acd \uc0\u8594  }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0} }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b). In the true world, (1, 2), the Spies also know this, so, as you can see in the Kripke model, M}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}12}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}1}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b)) ^ K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}2}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b)).}{\*\bkmkstart _GoBack}{\*\bkmkend _GoBack}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} We can even conclude from the Kripke model that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(\'aca \uc0\u8594  K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}1}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b))) ^ (\'acb \uc0\u8594  K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}2}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b))). Every player also knows this.\line Now, for the third mission it really depends who can propose a team. If player 1 proposes a team, it will never be accepted, since it\uc1\u8217\'92s known he is a Spy. If player 2 can propose a team, it would probably be the most logical to put himself and player 3 or 5 on a mission. Let us assume player 2 chooses player 3 to go with him. We already concluded that player 4 knows that player 2 is a Spy, so he will reject this mission. Now, for players 3 and 5, it can be a bit complicated. You could say that, since they know the both of them are good guys, it would be in their best interest to only accept a team consisting of them both. This would, however, give them no new information at all. This would only postpone the difficult decision a mission. Therefore, it might be the most logical choice for them to accept 2\uc1\u8216\'91s proposal. In that case, the mission will fail, and the Spies will win.\line Now suppose that player 4 can propose a team. If this is the case, 4 will propose a team consisting of himself and player 3 or 5. We assume he chose 4 and 5. For 3 and 5, the reasoning we had in the case of the team with 2 and 3 still holds. They have no reason to reject this mission, so they can accept it. 4 will (naturally) also accept this team. The mission will succeed, so it will be known that 4 is a Good player. Since it was already known that 3 and 5 were Good, every player can now conclude that 1 and 2 are Spies. This will result in a victory for team Good.\line If 3 or 5 can propose a team for the third mission, it basically comes down to chance. It would probably be best for them to propose a team consisting of themselves and player 2 or 4. Since they\uc1\u8217\'92ve got no way to distinguish between player 2 and 4, there is no reason to choose one over the other. We already saw the results for both of these teams, so they\uc1\u8217\'92ve basically got a 50% chance of winning. If this were a real game, players 3 and 5 would probably choose what to do based on social interaction.\line Let us get back to the second mission. We still have to look at the case where it contains one Spy. This can be either 1 or 2. It would not be illogical to put 1, 4 and 5 on the second mission. In this case, the mission will fail. Therefore, all the worlds where one of them is not a Spy won\uc1\u8217\'92t be possible anymore, and all the worlds with a combination of two of them are gone as well. This results in the following Kripke model:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch As you can see, only three possible worlds remain. 4 and 5 can\uc1\u8217\'92t distinguish between two of those. It is also interesting to see that 3 now knows the true state of the world. From (1, 2), 3 can not reach other worlds. Therefore, }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}M}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}12}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0} }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}3}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b). Since (1, 2) is also the remaining world where 3 isn\uc1\u8217\'92t a Spy, we can also conclude that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\'acc \uc0\u8594  K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}3}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}(a^b). Every player also knows this. It also becomes apparent that M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}4}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}((a^b)v(c^e)) and M }{\f0\fs22\b\lang1033{\*\listtag0}it is always true that }{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}K}{\f0\fs22\sub\lang1033{\*\listtag0}5}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}((a^b)v(c^d)).\line Now, for the third mission, it once again depends on who will propose the team. If player 1 or 2 proposes a team, it would be best for them to propose a team where they are on together. Player 3 will reject this, but for players 4 and 5, there\uc1\u8217\'92s no real reason to reject this. The chances that this mission will succeed are just 50% for them. Only accepting missions where they are on themselves won\uc1\u8217\'92t change this probability. Once again, it just comes down to a game of chance. If player 3 can propose a team, he will propose 3 and 5 or 3 and 4. 1 and 2 will always reject this mission. If they were Good, this would be a logical action, since then they would know that player 3 is a Spy. If they weren\uc1\u8217\'92t Good, as is the case, it would be a logical action as well, because accepting that mission will make them lose the game. For players 4 and 5 it\uc1\u8217\'92s once again just based on chance, since the same reasoning as before holds. \line The last possible option for mission two is that the team that goes on a mission consists of 2 and two other players. If we look at the case where 2, 3 and 4 go on a mission, we get the following Kripke model:}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sa200\sl276\slmult1\itap0{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch This model looks quite similar to the model we saw in the previous case. The big difference is that, in this model, there is no Good player that knows the true state of the world. All of them have two worlds between which they can\uc1\u8217\'92t see the difference. When proposing teams for the third mission, Good players now always have a 50% chance of choosing the right team. We can conclude that this is the worst scenario for them so far.\line It is interesting to see that, when there is one Spy on the first mission, it often becomes a game of chance for the Good players. Real games would probably be decided based on social interaction in those cases, or on voting behavior, which can especially give quite a lot away if players aren\uc1\u8217\'92t completely rational agents. It is also worth noting that even when you limit the possibilities of the Spies by making them fail all missions, they still have a decent chance of winning the game. However, this chance does increase if they have a choice, which is what we\uc1\u8217\'92ll be looking at next.}{\f0\fs22\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}}

					<h1>Introduction</h1>	
					<p>
					Welcome to our Multi-Agent Systems' Final Paper in the form of a (at the moment very ugly) website.
					</p>
					<p>
					We decided to devote our project to the analysis of the popular-amongst-its-players game of 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_%28game%29">"The Resistance"</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					On the next pages we will first explain the basic game + extentions, give our analysis and present you a piece of code that lets you create your own Kripke models.<br>
					The about page gives you some information about ourselves, meant for the stalkers among you.
					</p><p>
					Navigation can be done via the header-menu or the arrow keys. Some pages consist of several slides, indicated by the white arrows on the sides.

					<h1>The Resistance</h1>	
					<h2>Game Description</h2>
					<p>
					The Resistance is a social deduction game, commonly compared to the games Werewolves and 
					Mafia, with a team of "Good" characters competing against a team of "Bad" or "Spy" characters. The 
					Spy characters know their fellow Spy characters, whereas the Good characters only know their own 
					roles. The game consists of up to five rounds, with each round giving one point to either the Good or Spy 
					team. The first team to get 3 points wins.</p><p>
					At the end of each round, a set of nominated players goes on a mission that requires 
					cooperation from everyone on the mission. A Good character will always cooperate, whereas a Spy 
					character has the option to sabotage the mission. If everyone on the mission team cooperates, then the 
					Good team gets a point. If any Spy character on the mission team sabotages it, then the Spy team gets 
					a point, and the Good team knows at least one team member was a Spy (but not which). </p><p>
					To choose the mission team, players go in a circle proposing teams of n players. If the majority 
					of the players approve of the team, then that team goes on the mission. Otherwise, the next player 
					proposes a team, and the process is repeated. If everyone's nomination gets rejected, then the Bad 
					team automatically wins. The size of the mission team, n, changes for each round. </p><p>
					In addition to the standard "Good" and "Spy" roles, there exists optional roles which add or 
					obscure knowledge in various ways: 
					<ul style="text-align: left">
						<li> A Good character, "Merlin", that knows who all the Spies are. However, if at any point the Spies know who Merlin is, the Spies instantly win. </li>
						<li> A Good character, "Percival", that knows Merlin and one Spy, but cannot distinguish between them.</li> 
						<li> A Spy character, "Mordred", that is unknown to Merlin. </li>
						<li> A Spy character, "Oberon", that is unknown to other Spies, and does not know the other Spies. </li>
						<li> A pair of characters, the "Lancelots", whose allegiance may switch at random moments in the game.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h1>Analysis</h1>	
					<div class="slide"><div class="content">
					<h2>Simple game</h2>	
							<p>
							Let us first look at the simplest version of the game. In this version, there are two Spies and three Good players, who will go on five missions. 
							Good Players will always succeed a mission, and Spies always have to fail if they're on a mission. 
							Although this might not be the most interesting way to play the game, 
							it is a little bit easier to analyze. We could use this analysis as a basis for more elaborate versions of the game.
							Initially, the Kripke model will look like this:
							</p><p>
							No player can distinguish between the worlds where they are not Spies themselves. 
							From a world where a player is a Spy, that world is also the only reachable world, since the player then knows the actual alignment of all the players.
							The names of the worlds in this model correspond to the players that are Spies. 
							For instance, in world (1, 2), player 1 and player 2 are Spies. 
							Now let's assume that propositional atom a stands for "player 1 is a Spy", b stands for "player 2 is a Spy", etcetera. 
							Then we can also say that in world (1, 2), a and b are both true, and therefore (a^b) holds.
							</p><p>
In this version of the game, there are three distinct possibilities for the first mission: 
a mission with one Spy, a mission with two Spies and a mission without any spies. 
Let’s look at all of these different possibilities. 
If two Spies go on the first mission, they will both fail the mission. 
In this case, everybody knows that the two Spies were on this mission. Let’s assume that those Spies were player 1 and 2. The Kripke model will look like this afterwards:
